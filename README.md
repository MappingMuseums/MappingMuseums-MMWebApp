# MappingMuseums
Mapping Museums is a four-year AHRC-funded research project (2016-2020) that produced the first authoritative database of 
UK museums that opened and closed during a period of rapid expansion and change (1960 to the present day). 
It has provided the first evidence-based history of the development of independent museums and their links to wider cultural, social, and political concerns:
