    <h2>Actions 23 May</h2>
<pre>
  Actions: 
  Nick - 	Produce spreadsheets of columns generated from database that FC and JL can alter / re-order (use revised database outline for first version)
                Add in an additional option on date of opening / closing searches which is where the user provides a date range eg. 1978-1991
	        Consider approach to handling hierarchies that work for browsing and visualisation
	        Look at appropriate visualisations
	        Capitalise first letters of words in names of museums 

  Nick and Jamie - The year opening pair of columns (start / end) to be amalgamated into a single column.
  The closing pair of columns (start / end)  to be amalgamated into a single column.

  Nick and Alex look at governance being a single column rather than two (ie where database understand English heritage is independent and doesnt need additional column that reads independent)
  Think about a blog entry about the challenges / pleasures of building a database for the project (NB we-Fre still covering set up in the blog %Gâ€“%@ so maybe not the stuff were doing now?) Needs to be done in 5-6) weeks.

  Jamie  - Start / end terms to be replaced by from and to. 
	Translate ACE small / medium large etc. into visitor number ranges and add in  but only where were missing actual visitor numbers
	Ditto for AIM small / medium large 
	Send Nick spreadsheet of numbers

  Blog entry on practically collating information (needs to be done in 3-4 weeks)

  Fiona  look for data that links local authority to postcodes
	Look for info on historic and current counties
	Work out where grey area organisations sits in browse and search
	Work out where organisational type column sits in browse and search

  Fiona and Jamie  consider use of terms for search page and for date search terms eg. before not less than.

      <h2>Actions 12th Sep </h2>


<pre>
Columns to be merged:
1. Year of foundation and year of opening.
Where there is no year in ~year open~ column the date for foundation year should 
be copied over and an ~f~ put in the~ year open source~ column. 
2. The subject matter and collections tags column so that it reads 
Main subject / sub category e.g. Transport / planes
3. Governance. So it reads Independent / English heritage etc. 
Nick to consolidate columns, and pass back to Jamie prior to major upload of new data.
