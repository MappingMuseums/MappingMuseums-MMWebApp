<h1>Data</h1>
     <p>The projectâ€™s research team has gathered, cleansed, and codified data relating to over 4000 UK museums - almost double the number of museums covered in any previous survey. It covers the period from 1960 to date.
	 The challenges we faced and the processes we adopted to collect, integrate, and cleanse the data are described in our publications</p>
	 <p>The following files are available for download, which capture the status of the Mapping Museums database at the formal end of the project in September 2021: </p>
